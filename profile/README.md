Hi there! If you're just getting started here you should check out the information in the [swgoh-comlink](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink) repository and wiki.  It is an API client that you host yourself for talking to game APIs for the mobile phone game, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.  It's free to use, and delivered as both a docker image, and a limited variety of binary files for popular platforms (windows, mac, linux) in case you do not want to use docker.  The rest of the community tools hosted in this organization are open source and compliment or benefit from comlink- you should check them out too!  Contributions to the open source projects via forks and PR are welcome.
